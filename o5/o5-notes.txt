0x00 ldi %r2, 1			
0x04 ldi %r1, 1
0x08 mul %r2, %r2, %r0
0x0C sub %r0, %r0, %r1
0x10 cmp %r3, %r0, %r1
0x14 jgt %r3, -16

Start off by setting R1 and R2 to 1. R0 will be set to 2, 3, 4, or 9.
Then multiply R2 with whatever is in R0, and decrement R0 by 1.
This is done until the CMP between R0 and R1 = 1 is true.

The program will therefore perform the operation R2 = R0!:
R0 = 2 => R2 = 2
R0 = 3 => R2 = 6
R0 = 4 => R2 = 24
R0 = 9 => R2 = 362880
