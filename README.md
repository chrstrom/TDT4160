# TDT4160
Assignments (Ã˜vinger) for TDT4160 - Datamaskiner og digitalteknikk (H2019)
All project files will be tested on the EMF32GG-STK3700 and turned in on http://kdd2.idi.ntnu.no/.
Although the assignment instructions say to use Simplicity Studio, I would highly reccomend using PIO in VS Code
to make things easier in the long run. If you run into problems building the project with PIO, you can import
the files in a Simplicity project, and things should work without any issues. Refer to the Kompendium if any
problems arise.

God kok :)
